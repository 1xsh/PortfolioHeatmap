# ‚≠ê Portfolio Heatmap

A full-stack stock portfolio visualization application with a custom heatmap feature, built by a first-year computer science student to showcase professional-grade development skills.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## üìå Project Overview
Portfolio Heatmap is a web application designed to help users manage and visualize their stock portfolios through an interactive heatmap, inspired by Finviz's S&P 500 heatmap. Unlike traditional heatmaps, this app focuses on user-defined portfolios or custom stock lists, with square sizes representing the percentage of the portfolio and colors indicating price performance (e.g., green for gains, red for losses).

This project is a work-in-progress full-stack application built to professional standards, demonstrating advanced skills in backend development (Spring Boot), database management (MySQL), API integration (FMP, Alpha Vantage), user authentication (Spring Security with JWT), and soon, front-end development (React) and cloud deployment (AWS). As a 19-year-old first-year computer science student, I'm using this project to challenge myself, learn advanced concepts, and create a portfolio piece that stands out for internship applications. The backend is now mostly complete, and I'm currently focusing on learning React to build a high-quality front end that matches the backend's capabilities.

## üöÄ Current Features
### üìä Stock Management:
- CRUD operations for stocks (add, view, delete stocks).
- Populate stock data using Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /stocks`
  - `GET /stocks/{id}`
  - `POST /stocks`
  - `POST /stocks/populate`
  - `DELETE /stocks/{id}`

### üìà Stock Price Retrieval:
- Fetch real-time stock prices using Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API (250 requests/day, free tier) with Alpha Vantage as a fallback (5/min, 25/day).
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /stocks/price/{symbol}`
  - `GET /stocks/batch-prices?symbols=AAPL,MSFT,TSLA`

### ‚è≥ Historical Price Updates:
- Update historical prices in the database for visualization and performance calculations.
- Populate historical price data for all stocks.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `PUT /stocks/{id}/update-price`
  - `POST /stocks/price-history/populate-all`

### üìÖ Daily Price Updates:
- Automatically update the `price_history` table with the latest closing prices for all stocks every day at 6:00 PM EST (after market close).
- Uses batch requests to fetch prices efficiently within FMP's rate limits (300 requests/min, paid plan).
- Ensures historical data integrity with duplicate checks to prevent redundant entries.
- Caches current prices to reduce API calls and improve performance.

### üìÅ Portfolio Management:
- Full CRUD operations for portfolios: create, view, and delete portfolios for authenticated users.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /portfolios/create?name=PortfolioName`
  - `GET /portfolios/user`
  - `GET /portfolios/{portfolioId}`
  - `DELETE /portfolios/{portfolioId}`

### üìä Portfolio Holdings Management:
- Add, update, and delete stock holdings within a portfolio.
- Mark holdings as sold by adding a selling price and date.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /portfolios/{portfolioId}/holdings/add?ticker=AAPL&shares=10&purchasePrice=150.25&purchaseDate=2024-06-15`
  - `PUT /portfolios/holdings/{holdingId}?shares=10&sellingPrice=225.50&sellingDate=2025-03-25`
  - `DELETE /portfolios/holdings/{holdingId}`

### üî• Portfolio Heatmap Visualization:
- Interactive heatmap displaying stocks from the user's portfolio.
- Square sizes based on the percentage of the portfolio (larger squares for higher allocation).
- Square colors based on price performance (green for gains, red for losses).
- Dynamic text sizing based on rectangle dimensions for better readability.
- Multiple timeframe options (1d, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, YTD, 1y, Total).

### üé® Modern User Interface:
- Responsive dark theme design across all components.
- Fixed header with social media links and navigation.
- Clean, intuitive portfolio and timeframe selection.
- Consistent styling across login, registration, and main application pages.

### üìà Performance Metrics:
- Calculate key portfolio metrics: total portfolio value, total open/closed gains/losses, and percentage returns.
- Per-holding gains/losses and percentage returns for both open and closed positions.
- Uses historical price data to compute unrealized gains/losses for open positions.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database:
- MySQL database with tables for stocks, portfolios, holdings, users, and historical prices.
- Normalized schema with foreign key relationships (e.g., `portfolio_holdings` links to `portfolios` and `stocks`).

![EER Diagram](EER_Diagram.png)

### üèó Backend Architecture:
- Spring Boot with a clean separation of concerns (controllers, services, repositories).
- Flexible stock data provider setup using a factory pattern (`StockDataServiceFactory`) to switch between FMP and Alpha Vantage.
- Resolved serialization issues (circular references, large responses) using Jackson annotations (`@JsonIdentityInfo`, `@JsonIgnore`).

### üîê User Authentication:
- Spring Security with JWT for user registration, login, and role-based access control.
- Secure endpoints to ensure users can only access their own portfolios.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /auth/register`
  - `POST /auth/login`
